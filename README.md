This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in R programming related to floating-point number comparisons.  Floating-point numbers are not always represented exactly in binary, leading to potential inaccuracies. The `bug.r` file illustrates this with a simple example where the sum of 0.1 and 0.2 is compared to 0.3.  The solution (`bugSolution.r`) suggests using an appropriate tolerance for comparisons instead of direct equality checks.
